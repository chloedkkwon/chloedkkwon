## Hello, welcome 👋

My name is Dokyung Kwon. The first part sounds like [togjʌŋ] or 'TOH-GYUNG', but I prefer to go by **Chloe** because I like the name!

I started doing research in phonetics in 2017 when I wanted to help Korean L2 learners of English improve their pronunciation. Over time, my focus shifted toward a more cognitive perspective, specifically, how variability in speech maps onto sound categories and words in our minds. If you are curious about my research, please visit [my website](https://chloedkkwon.github.io/).

I'm also fascinated by different **experimental, statistical, and computational approaches to modeling data**, which is a big part of why I fell in love with phonetics!

🛠️ When it comes to tools, I regularly use MATLAB, R, and Python, each for different purposes:
- **MATLAB** for acoustic data, signal processing, and data visualization
- **R** for statistical analyses and data visualization
- **Python** for data cleaning, machine learning, and deep neural networks

I will continue sharing my codes to help those starting their own research or language-related data science projects. 

Feel free to reach me at [dk837@cornell.edu](mailto:dk837@cornell.edu) or [chloe.dkkwon@gmail.com](mailto:chloe.dkkwon@gmail.com) if you have any questions!
