## Hello, I'm Dokyung. You can call me Chloe.

I started doing research in phonetics to help Korean L2 learners of English improve their pronunciation. Over time, my focus shifted toward a more cognitive perspective, specifically, how variability in speech maps onto sound categories and words in our minds. If you are curious about my linguistic research, please visit [my website](https://chloedkkwon.github.io/).

I'm also fascinated by different **experimental, statistical, and computational approaches to modeling data**, which is a big part of why I fell in love with research.

When it comes to tools, I regularly use MATLAB, R, and Python, each for different purposes:
- **MATLAB** for signal processing and data visualization (especially time series data)
- **R** for statistical analyses and data visualization (especially model predictions)
- **Python** for data cleaning, machine learning, deep neural networks, LLMs

I will continue to share my code to help those starting their own research or data science projects.
