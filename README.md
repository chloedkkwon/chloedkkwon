## Hello, welcome 👋

My name is Dokyung Kwon. The first part sounds like [togjʌŋ] or 'TOH-GYUNG', but I prefer to go by **Chloe** because I like the name!

I started doing research in phonetics in 2017 when I wanted to help Korean L2 learners of English improve their pronunciation. Over time, my focus shifted toward a more cognitive perspective, specifically, how variability in speech maps onto sound categories and words in our minds.

I'm also fascinated by different experimental, statistical, and computational approaches to modeling data, which is a big part of why I fell in love with phonetics!

When it comes to tools, I regularly use MATLAB, R, and Python, each for different purposes:
- **MATLAB** for acoustic data, signal processing, and data visualization
- **R** for statistical analyses and data visualization
- **Python** for data cleaning, machine learning, and deep neural networks

I will continue sharing my codes to help those starting their own research or language-related data science projects. 

Feel free to reach me at [dk837@cornell.edu](mailto:dk837@cornell.edu) or [chloe.dkkwon@gmail.com](mailto:chloe.dkkwon@gmail.com) if you have any questions!
